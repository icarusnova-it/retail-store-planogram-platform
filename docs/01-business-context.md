# Business Context

## What is Planogramming?

Planogramming (planometría) is the practice of designing and organizing product displays in retail stores to optimize sales, customer experience, and operational efficiency. In supermarkets and large retail operations, planograms are critical tools for:

- **Visual Merchandising**: Creating appealing product displays
- **Space Optimization**: Maximizing sales per square foot
- **Category Management**: Organizing products by category and subcategory
- **Operational Efficiency**: Facilitating restocking and inventory management
- **Compliance**: Ensuring adherence to brand guidelines and regulations

## The Problem with Current Approaches

### 1. Static Documents (PDFs, Images)

**Current State:**
- Planograms stored as PDF files or images
- No structured data
- Difficult to update and version
- Cannot be queried or analyzed programmatically

**Problems:**
- Manual updates required
- Version control difficult
- No automated validation
- Limited analytics capabilities

**Example**: Planogram stored as PDF. To change product placement, designer must recreate entire PDF.

### 2. Spreadsheets (Excel)

**Current State:**
- Planograms managed in Excel spreadsheets
- Some structure, but limited
- Manual data entry
- Prone to errors

**Problems:**
- No validation rules
- Difficult to maintain consistency
- Limited collaboration
- No integration with other systems

**Example**: Store manager maintains Excel with product positions. Updates manually, errors common.

### 3. Photos and Manual Notes

**Current State:**
- Store execution validated with photos
- Manual notes and checklists
- No digital connection to planogram

**Problems:**
- No systematic tracking
- Difficult to compare across stores
- No analytics
- Time-consuming audits

**Example**: Auditor takes photos of shelves, compares manually with printed planogram.

## Impact on Business

### Sales Impact

**Optimized Planograms:**
- Increase sales per square foot
- Improve product visibility
- Enhance customer shopping experience
- Drive impulse purchases

**Poor Planogram Execution:**
- Lost sales opportunities
- Reduced customer satisfaction
- Lower basket size
- Decreased store performance

**Example**: Properly executed planogram increases category sales by 15-20%.

### Operational Impact

**Efficient Planograms:**
- Faster restocking
- Reduced out-of-stock situations
- Better inventory management
- Lower labor costs

**Inefficient Execution:**
- Longer restocking times
- More frequent out-of-stock
- Higher labor costs
- Operational inefficiencies

**Example**: Well-designed planogram reduces restocking time by 30%.

### Compliance Impact

**Compliance Requirements:**
- Brand guidelines
- Regulatory requirements
- Category management rules
- Store-specific constraints

**Non-Compliance:**
- Brand penalties
- Regulatory violations
- Customer confusion
- Operational issues

**Example**: Non-compliance with brand guidelines results in penalties and lost promotions.
