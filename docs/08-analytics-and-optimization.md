**Example**: Average execution time reduced from 4 hours to 2.5 hours.

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Placement Optimization

**Purpose**: Optimize product placement for sales.

**Strategies:**
- **Eye-Level Optimization**: Place high-rotation products at eye level
- **Facing Optimization**: Optimize facings based on rotation
- **Category Flow**: Optimize category flow for customer journey
- **Brand Positioning**: Optimize brand positioning

**Process:**
1. Analyze current placement
2. Identify optimization opportunities
3. Test variations
4. Measure impact
5. Implement optimal placement

**Example**: Move high-rotation products to eye level → 12% sales increase.

### 2. Space Optimization

**Purpose**: Optimize space allocation for maximum sales.

**Strategies:**
- **Category Space**: Allocate space based on sales velocity
- **Product Space**: Optimize space per product
- **Linear Feet**: Optimize linear feet allocation
- **Space Efficiency**: Maximize sales per square foot

**Process:**
1. Analyze space utilization
2. Identify underperforming space
3. Reallocate space
4. Measure impact
5. Optimize further

**Example**: Reallocate space from low-rotation to high-rotation → 18% sales increase.

### 3. Rule Optimization

**Purpose**: Optimize placement rules based on performance.

**Strategies:**
- **Rule Performance**: Analyze rule performance
- **Rule Refinement**: Refine rules based on data
- **New Rules**: Create new rules based on insights
- **Rule Prioritization**: Prioritize rules based on impact

**Process:**
1. Analyze rule compliance and performance
2. Identify rule improvements
3. Test rule changes
4. Measure impact
5. Implement optimal rules

**Example**: Refine eye-level rule based on sales data → 8% sales increase.

### 4. Category Optimization

**Purpose**: Optimize category placement and organization.

**Strategies:**
- **Category Flow**: Optimize category flow
- **Category Adjacency**: Optimize category adjacency
- **Category Size**: Optimize category space allocation
- **Category Performance**: Optimize based on performance

**Process:**
1. Analyze category performance
2. Identify optimization opportunities
3. Test category changes
4. Measure impact
5. Implement optimal category layout

**Example**: Optimize category flow → 10% sales increase.

## Feedback Loop
